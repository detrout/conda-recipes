* Introduction

Various recipes to build conda packages for software I was using in
[[https://github.com/detrout/woldrnaseq-wrappers][woldrnaseq-wrappers]] for snakemake wrappers for a pipeline in
[[https://github.com/detrout/woldlab-rna-seq/][woldlab-rna-seq]]

| wrapper          | description                                                                      |
| encoded-client   | Provides wrapper around ENCODE/IGVF portal REST object databases                 |
| mex-gene-archive | Stores matrix market gene quantification files with row and column labels and a small manifest file in a tar file |
| star-conda       | a specific version of the STAR rna aligner for my pipeline                       |
| woldlab-rna-seq  | Pipeline and reporting software                                                  |

* Building

I didn't feel like uploading this to public repositories so I built
and hosted my own conda channel.

(I'm writing this quite a while after I actually deployed this so this
instructions might be wrong)

A recipe can be built and installed into a directory for sharing with
the [[https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/commands/conda-build.html][conda-build]] command

#+begin_src bash
  CHANNEL_DIR=~/public_html/conda/
  conda-build --output-folder ${CHANNEL_DIR} ${recipe}
#+end_src

Once the package is built and installed into the channel directory
tree, I think it needs an index to be updated with [[https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/commands/conda-index.html][conda-index]]

#+begin_src bash
  pushd ${CHANNEL_DIR}
  conda-index
  popd
#+end_src
